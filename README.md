# Advanced todo example laravel 10 and vuejs 3

In this project I'm demonstrating an advanced todo example with users, jwt auth, todo groups, dockerization and server with nginx.

## Getting Started

### Usage
Build services;

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```
This command build laravel, nginx and vuejs services. After that project will be ready to use on `http://localhost:81`
